JPG Corruptor was the inspiration of my brother-in-law who is an art student. 

The idea is to inject the text of a book into a JPG file corrupting. It turns out that most
JPG files are quite reslient to such corruption and the resulting images can be quite interesting.

## Download
[JPG Corruptor app for Windows] (https://github.com/downloads/tig/JPG-Corruptor/JPGCorrupt.zip)
## Instructions
* Run this little Windows app.
* Choose a text file (e.g. the first chapter of The Great Gatsby)
* Choose a JPG (e.g. an image from the movie The Great Gatsby)
* Click on the Go (or Go Full Screen) button
* Watch it unfold
* When in full screen mode, ESC will stop it
* You can always find the last image generated in the executables directory named "Corrupt 0000.jpg".

## Notes
* Some JPG files get massively corrupted really quickly. It appears that those saved by Photoshop are more resilient than others.
* Some JPG renderers display the corrupt JPGs differently. FireFox, IE, and Chrome all have subtle differences. Windows picture preview is *very* different. 
* Flickr refuses to upload some of these images.
* Photoshop tends to not want to open these files
* Paint (Windows) opens them fine, but fails to save them.
* Paint.NET opens them fine and then saves them fine. After it saves them they appear to be openable by anything (e.g. Flickr upload works.)
* The larger the JPG image the slower the app is, but the more interesting the results.
* Each word of the text file overwrites JPG data at a random spot. 
* I tried inserting the text data but that caused the files to be quickly unreadable.

## Future work
* I currently avoid overwitting JPG data in the first 256 bytes of the file. I intentionally didn't read any JPG specs but I assumed there's some form of header. I plan on experimenting with this.
* The text is randomly spread around the file.  I plan on implementing a mode where it over writes JPG data sequentially (or at least biasing it from top to bottom over time).
* Originally I implemented this such that it saved every JPG along the way. The code for that mode is still there but is disabled. You can always find the last image generated in the executables directory named "Corrupt 0000.jpg".
