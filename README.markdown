JPG Corruptor
====================

A digital art expiriment.
---------------------

JPG Corruptor was the inspiration of my brother-in-law who is an art student. 

The idea is to inject the text of a book into a JPG file corrupting. It turns out that most
JPG files are quite reslient to such corruption and the resulting images can be quite interesting.
